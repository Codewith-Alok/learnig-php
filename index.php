<?php
// Basic PHP program

$name = "Alok";
$age = 20;

echo "Hello, my name is " . $name . "<br>";
echo "I am " . $age . " years old.";
?>

/* Explanation (Simple)

<?php ... ?> → PHP code starts and ends here

$name, $age → Variables in PHP (always start with $)

echo → Used to display output

<br> → Line break in HTML */
